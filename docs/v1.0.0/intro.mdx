# Welcome to SmallPict 🚀

Hi there! Welcome to the official documentation for **SmallPict**.

If you are looking to make your WordPress site faster, lighter, and more efficient without bloating your own server, you are in the right place.

## What is SmallPict?

SmallPict is a **Serverless Image Optimizer** plugin for WordPress.

Unlike traditional plugins that use your hosting server's CPU to compress images (making your site slow while editing), SmallPict offloads all that heavy lifting to the cloud. Specifically, we use **AWS Lambda** to process your images instantly and securely.

## Main Features

We focus on three core pillars to optimize your media library:

1.  **Convert**: automatically converts heavy formats (like PNG or JPG) into modern, next-gen formats like **WebP** (and AVIF for Pro users). This drastically reduces file size while maintaining quality.
2.  **Compress**: Uses intelligent algorithms to squeeze out unnecessary bytes. Your images look great, but load much faster.
3.  **Optimize**: Handles resizing and metadata cleanup automatically on upload.

## Cloud Support ☁️

Currently, SmallPict is built exclusively for **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

You connect the plugin to your own AWS account, giving you full control over your data and costs. We don't store your images on our servers; they go directly from your WordPress to your private AWS Lambda and back.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Azure is planned for future releases. Stay tuned!
