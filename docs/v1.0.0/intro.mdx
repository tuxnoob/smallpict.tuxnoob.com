# Welcome to SmallPict 🚀

Hi there! Welcome to the official documentation for **SmallPict** - The Serverless Image Optimizer for WordPress.

If you are looking to make your WordPress site **faster**, **lighter**, and **more efficient** without bloating your own server, you are in the right place.

---

## What is SmallPict?

SmallPict is a next-generation image optimization service for WordPress.

Unlike traditional plugins that use your hosting server's CPU to compress images (making your site slow), SmallPict offloads **100% of the work** to our specialized infrastructure.

**The result?** Your site stays fast, your server stays cool, and your images look perfect.

## Core Features

We focus on three pillars:

### 1. Intelligent Conversion 🔄
Automatically converts heavy legacy formats (PNG, JPG) into modern, ultra-light formats like **WebP** and **AVIF**. This drastically reduces file size by up to 90% without visible quality loss.

### 2. Smart Compression 📉
Our smart engine analyzes every image to find the perfect balance between file size and visual fidelity.

### 3. Automatic Optimization ⚡
Just upload images to your media library as usual. SmallPict handles resizing, EXIF cleanup, and optimization in the background.

## How it Works ☁️

1.  **You Upload**: You add an image to WordPress.
2.  **We Optimize**: The plugin instantly sends it to the SmallPict Cloud.
3.  **We Return**: A perfectly optimized version replaces the original (or sits alongside it, depending on your settings).

**No complex setup.** You do NOT need your own cloud server, API keys, or specialized knowledge. It just works.
