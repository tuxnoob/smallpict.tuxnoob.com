# Welcome to SmallPict 🚀

Hi there! Welcome to the official documentation for **SmallPict** - The Serverless Image Optimizer for WordPress.

If you are looking to make your WordPress site **faster**, **lighter**, and **more efficient** without bloating your own server, you are in the right place.

---

## What is SmallPict?

SmallPict is a plugin that offloads image optimization to the cloud.

Unlike traditional plugins that use your hosting server's CPU to compress images (making your site slow while editing), SmallPict uses **AWS Lambda** to process your images instantly, securely, and cheaply.

## Core Features

We focus on three pillars:

### 1. Convert 🔄
Automatically converts heavy formats (like PNG or JPG) into modern, next-gen formats like **WebP** (and AVIF for Pro users). This drastically reduces file size while maintaining quality.

### 2. Compress 📉
Uses intelligent algorithms to squeeze out unnecessary bytes. Your images look great, but load much faster.

### 3. Optimize ⚡
Handles resizing and metadata cleanup automatically on upload.

---

## Cloud Support ☁️

Currently, SmallPict is built exclusively for **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

You connect the plugin to your own AWS account, giving you full control over your data and costs. We don't store your images on our servers; they go directly from your WordPress to your private AWS Lambda and back.

<Callout type="note">
Support for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Azure is planned for future releases. Stay tuned!
